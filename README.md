## Overview

`problems.md` contains multiple algorithm challenges. This repository contains solutions to those challenges

## Getting Started

### Compatability

To be able to run the code make sure you have Node 19.0 or later installed

### Running examples

- Make sure you installed the dependencies inside package.json by executing `npm install` in your terminal

- Open `index.ts` in a code editor and modify the function coresponding to the solution you are trying to test

- run `npm run build` to build the project

- run `npm run start` to execute the code

### Testing

Jest is used for testing

- run `npm run test` to run every test in the project
- run `npm run fibTest` to run the test concerning the non-fibonacci sequence problem
- run `npm run lruTest` to run every test related to the LRU Cache problem
- run `npm run dAndRuleTest` to run every test related to the Divide And Rule problem
- run `npm run balancedParenthesisTest` to run every test related to the balanced parenthesis problem
